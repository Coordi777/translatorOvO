# Translator (划词翻译)

- Based on [Baidu API](http://api.fanyi.baidu.com/product/113).

- Two modes: Manual or **Automatic**.
- As for AUTO, you can use the **Mouse swipe** to select words or use the **Keyboard Ctrl+C** shortcut keys to translate. (use switch **BUTTON** to change)
- The global selection of words depends on the **operation of the clipboard**, which is not supported by some software, so you can choose to use the keyboard.



## Usage

1. First you need to have your own Baidu Translation ID and KEY: [Tutorials](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/3f16e00305bb552591c10304.html)

2. Then replace the code:

   ```python
   	gui = GUI(appid='your_id', key='your_key')
   ```

3. Finally, have fun.🥳🥳
